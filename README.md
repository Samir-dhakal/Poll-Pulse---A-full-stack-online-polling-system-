PollPulse follows a modular, layered architecture:

- **Backend Services:** A Spring Boot application exposes a REST API for core functionality (creating polls, voting) and a WebSocket endpoint for broadcasting real-time results.  
- **Frontend Interface:** A separate React application consumes these APIs to provide an interactive user experience.  
- **Data Persistence:** An in-memory H2 database is used for local development, providing persistent storage for all poll data.
