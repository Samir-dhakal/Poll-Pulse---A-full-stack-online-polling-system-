PollPulse: A Real-Time Interactive Polling PlatformA modern, full-stack web application designed for real-time engagement and feedback. PollPulse provides a seamless platform for users to create, share, and participate in live polls, with results updating instantly as votes are cast. This project was developed to demonstrate core principles of back-end and front-end development, real-time communication, and data persistence.üåü Key FeaturesReal-time Live Updates: Poll results are instantly updated on a dynamic dashboard using WebSocket technology.Flexible Participation: Supports both anonymous and identified voting to suit various contexts.Automated Poll Management: Polls can be configured to automatically close after a set duration.Secure Data Storage: All poll data and results are securely stored in a database for future analysis.Intuitive User Interface: A clean, user-friendly React-based interface for effortless poll creation and participation.Robust Backend: Built with Spring Boot for a scalable and maintainable application.üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackBackendLanguage: JavaFramework: Spring BootBuild Tool: MavenDependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring WebSocketDatabase: H2 Database (for local development)FrontendLibrary: React.jsLanguage: JavaScriptPackage Manager: npmVisualization: Chart.js (for dynamic result dashboards)üèóÔ∏è ArchitecturePollPulse follows a modular, layered architecture:Backend Services: A Spring Boot application exposes a REST API for core functionality (creating polls, voting) and a WebSocket endpoint for broadcasting real-time results.Frontend Interface: A separate React application consumes these APIs to provide an interactive user experience.Data Persistence: An in-memory H2 database is used for local development, providing persistent storage for all poll data.üöÄ Getting StartedFollow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.PrerequisitesJava Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higherA code editor (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA)npm (Node.js)1. Backend SetupClone the repository and navigate to the project root:git clone https://github.com/your-username/pollpulse.git
cd pollpulse
Run the Spring Boot application using the Maven wrapper:./mvnw spring-boot:run
The backend will start on http://localhost:8080.2. Frontend SetupNavigate to the frontend directory:cd pollpulse-frontend
Install the dependencies:npm install
Start the React application:npm start
The frontend will open in your browser on http://localhost:3000.‚è≠Ô∏è Future EnhancementsUser Authentication: Implement Spring Security for user login and registration, allowing users to manage their own polls.Live Charts: Integrate a dynamic charting library (like Chart.js) to visualize poll results in real time.Poll History: Add a feature to view a history of all created and past polls.ü§ù ContributorsSamir DhakalAayusha Kuikel
